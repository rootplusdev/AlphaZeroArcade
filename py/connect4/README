STEPS

* Set up external perfect solver
  * Clone this repo: https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4
  * Download the opening book ("7x6.book") from here and copy to that directory: https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4/releases/tag/book
  * Build the binary via make
  * TODO: take care of above via git-submodule + setup script?

* Set up config:
  * Make a file at repo root called config.txt
  * Add the line "c4.solver_dir = <dir>" to this file, where <dir> is the directory of your above cloned repo

* Generate training data
  * ./generate_training_data.py -n 10000  # generates 10k games of random-self-play data
  * Can accelerate the above by install openmpi and running with k-fold parallelism like so:
       mpirun -n k ./generate_training_data.py -n 10000
  * Writes data to c4_games/ by default

* Train a model:
  * ./train_nn.py
  * Reads data from c4_games/ by default, writes to c4_model.ptj by default

* Play against the CPU, creating a debug file:
  * ./play_vs_cpu.py -d debug.xml
  * Loads c4_model.ptj by default

* Visualize the debug file:
  * cd $REPO_ROOT/js; npm start
  * Should open up http://localhost:3000/ in browser, upload your file
  * TODO: there is some npm instruction missing here, I think - doesn't seem to work at present
