STEPS

* Set up external perfect solver
  * Clone this repo: https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4
  * Will refer to that directory as $CONNECT4
  * Download the opening book ("7x6.book") from here and copy to $CONNECT4/: https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4/releases/tag/book
  * Build the binary via make
  * TODO: take care of above via git-submodule + setup script?

* Generate training data
  * Make sure "openmpi" is installed. Otherwise install it.
  * mpirun -n 6 ./generate_training_data.py -c $CONNECT4 -n 10000
  * Above uses 6 cores. Pass different value based on your hardware. Leave out "mpirun -n 6" for single-process.
  * Instead of passing -c $CONNECT4, can add a mapping for "c4.solver_dir" in the git-ignored $REPO_ROOT/config.txt
  * Writes data to c4_games/ by default

* Train a model:
  * ./train_nn.py
  * Reads data from c4_games/ by default, writes to c4_model.pt by default

* Play against the CPU, creating a debug file:
  * ./play_vs_cpu.py -d debug.xml
  * Loads c4_model.pt by default

* Visualize the debug file:
  * cd $REPO_ROOT/js; npm start
  * Should open up http://localhost:3000/ in browser, upload your file
